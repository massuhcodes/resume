            <p>
                I love coding React.js web applications for its simplicity in writing clean code. I gained and mastered Frontend fundamentals in <b>HTML</b>, <b>CSS</b>, <b>JavaScript</b>, <b>Git</b>, and <b>React.js</b> by building useful and scalable projects. Open to both learning and growing from tried-and-true developers, I seek to be integral in a team that prioritizes clean-code design principles. I also hold myself to be a problem-solver and acknowledge that I know nothing as there's always more to learn.
